    <p1>WHY DO I WANT TO BE A DEVELOPER?
       I think Benjamin Franklin said it best
       <br>
       "Many people die at twenty five and aren't buried intil they are seventy five."

            Hello!  My name is Andy Wade and I am curently a full time student enrolled in DevCodeCamp.
        <br>
                I have always been very curious about how things work.  
                When other kids where trying to get to the last level of Mario Bro. I was taking the cartridge apart to see what it looked like on the inside.
                One day I decided to take my fathers BB gun apart to see how it worked and I couldn't get it back together, so I put the pieces in a paper bag 
                to try again later.  A few days later my father asked where it was, and I handed it to him in the paper bag.  I was in BIG trouble!  
                Dear Ole Dad gave me 15 minutes to put it back into working order or else.  But that's not what got to me.  As I was walking away mother ask him
                "Don't you think you where a little hard on him?" to which he replied, "Yeah, your right, I don't think he's smart enough to do it...  I don't think <i><strong>I'm</i></strong> smart enough to do it either!"
                CHALLENGE ACCEPTED!
                  I put that thing together faster than a marine fresh out of bootcamp.  Ever since that day I've felt there was no problem I could not solve.  
                The challenging ones I did first, the imposible ones are taking a little bit longer.
