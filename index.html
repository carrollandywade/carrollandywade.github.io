        I have always been very curious about how things work.  
        When other kids where trying to get to the last level of Mario Bro. I was taking the cartride apart to see what it looked like on the inside.
        One day I decided to take my fathers BB gun apart to see how it worked and I couldn't get it back together so I put the pieces in a paper bag 
        to try again later.  One few days later my father asked where it was and I handed it to him in the paper bag.  I was in BIG trouble!  
        Dear Ole Dad gave me 15 minutes to put it back into working order or else.  ...but that's not what got to me.  As I was walking away mother ask 
        "Don't you think you where a little hard on him?" to which he replied, "Yeah, your right, I don't think he's smart enough to do it.  I don't think I'm smart enough to do it!"
        CHALLENGE ACCEPTED!  I put that thing together faster than a marine fresh out of bootcamp.  Ever since that day I've felt there was no problem I could not solve.  
        The challenging ones I did first, the imposible ones are taking a little bit longer.
