            Why do we need developers?<br>
            History gives many examples of how technology changed civilization throughout time.  Words like: the bronze-age, the iron-age, and the space-age
            get knocked around all the time.  Some people believe natural resources are what make a nation like ours prosperous.  They will talk about
            the gold rush, the oil rush as if those where events that launced us into superpower status, and of course there is the industrial revolution.
            However, everyone seems to overlook the catilyst that began all of those events.  In fact I dare say that everytime there is a major advacement in 
            technology or any advancement in society it could never have happened had it not been for one key element that everyone seems to take for granted.

            Do you know when the first steam engine was invented?  If you said "Umm, around 1712ish..." you were wrong.  Did you know it was invented about 
            2000 years ago!  Of course, they didn't have steam locomotives back in ancient Greese so what happened?  They had sailboats, why not slap a steam engine
            on a sailboat and BOOM tell Christopher Colombus to take the day off!  Did you know that Nicoli Tesla probably invented voice-radio while Marconi was
            still working with the Morse code?  These guys had technology ahead of their time and yet they did nothing with it, why?
            <br>

               What would you say if I told you that history has it all wrong, that tecnology and resourses are not what define an erra but rather communication!  
            Why did we not have trans-continental railroads in the dark-ages, because the library of Alexandria burned down before someone with an imagination
            could read about it.  Why did Tesla not tell Marconi to take a hike, because it was just the side-effect of one of his experiments and he didn't think
            it was important.  The truth is major inovation always seems to come behind a major breakthrough in communication.  For the Ancient world it was paper and
            sailing vessels that could carry copper and tin.  After that it was the Roman road system.  Then it was the printing press that allowed early scientist
            to share notes quicker than ever.  The steam engine allowed people for the first time in history to travel long distances safely, before that it took
            months to cross the attlantic, suddenly they could do it in 2 weeks!  The telegraph, radio, telephone, TV, transatlantic flight.  All of these things
            allowed us to share ideas faster than ever before.
            <br>
        </p> 
        <p>
           Now here we are!  Communication his faster and more accessable than ever before.  What's that you invented a steam engine, send me a picture.
            Just discovered oil and don't know what to do with it, click here!  The library in Alexandria just burned down, don't worry we backed it up on the 
            server you'll be fine.  Honestly, I'm excited, who know's what the next technological age will bring, all because of a dveloper.

            Hello!  My name is Andy Wade and I am curently a full time student enrolled in DevCodeCamp.
        <br>
                I have always been very curious about how things work.  
                When other kids where trying to get to the last level of Mario Bro. I was taking the cartridge apart to see what it looked like on the inside.
                One day I decided to take my fathers BB gun apart to see how it worked and I couldn't get it back together, so I put the pieces in a paper bag 
                to try again later.  A few days later my father asked where it was, and I handed it to him in the paper bag.  I was in BIG trouble!  
                Dear Ole Dad gave me 15 minutes to put it back into working order or else.  But that's not what got to me.  As I was walking away mother ask him
                "Don't you think you where a little hard on him?" to which he replied, "Yeah, your right, I don't think he's smart enough to do it...  I don't think <i><strong>I'm</i></strong> smart enough to do it either!"
                CHALLENGE ACCEPTED!  I put that thing together faster than a marine fresh out of bootcamp.  Ever since that day I've felt there was no problem I could not solve.  
                The challenging ones I did first, the imposible ones are taking a little bit longer.
